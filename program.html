While it remains possible and vital to promote open science principles, librarians must be frank about the challenges facing researchers and communicate in a manner that takes their concerns seriously. Analyzing past studies on why researchers do not share data alongside current challenges, this presentation will discuss three distinct reasons researchers may be hesitant to share data—insufficient time or funds, fear of misrepresentation, and concern for misuse—and provide suggestions on how librarians of all levels can effectively engage with these concerns in outreach to researchers.</div>

<br /><br /><strong>Building a Data Services Plan from the Ground Up: A Practical Approach </strong><ul class="vertical-list"><li>Paul De Barros (Santa Clara University)</ul><button type="button" class="collapsible">Show/Hide Abstract</button><div class="content">With the need for data literacy and access to data resources growing among students and faculty, the Library at Santa Clara University recognized the need for a Data Services Plan. A primarily undergraduate teaching institution, SCU is pursuing a new strategic direction to support more faculty research, amplifying the need for the library to respond with intentionality and agility. However, data plan models for R01 institutions needed to be scaled appropriately to meet both current and projected needs. This poster outlines the process of developing a data services strategy from the ground up without prior experience or institutional precedent. It involved considering user needs, library capabilities, future planning, and building new partnerships.<br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li>What questions to ask when developing a data services plan</li><li>how to develop initiatives goals and specific activities to support them</li><li>creation of the plan as a professional development experience</ul></div>

Since many RDM publications/workshops focus on more advanced practices, I identified ‘good enough' data practices to meet researchers where they are in terms of RDM skills and time/effort they can dedicate. ‘Good enough' practices need to be low effort, have a shallow learning curve, have immediate and future benefits, and increase data reusability. I have delivered ‘good enough' practices to researchers at various stages from graduate students through mid-career faculty as part of stand-alone workshops, bootcamps, and choose-your-own-adventure style of training driven by audience interest. Feedback indicates attendees are motivated to implement these practices and often request additional, in-depth workshops on various RDM components. This presentation will appeal to attendees interested in providing RDM workshops in preparation for emerging open data policies.<br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li>Researchers may have advanced statistical or other data skills and still have gaps in research data management skills that limit the reusability of their data</li><li>Starting with ‘good enough' practices increases the likelihood that researchers will adopt changes and provides a foundation for more advanced open data practices</li><li>Framing research data management as a way to boost researcher productivity and lab efficiency can increase engagement and buy-in</li></ul></div>

Co-sponsored by University Libraries, Research Computing, and the Graduate School, SHARPGrads exposes graduate students in all disciplines to data skills and concepts that are required for graduate work but are often not included in the curriculum. Since its first iteration in 2019 as a two-day, in-person event, SHARPGrads has evolved into a year-long virtual workshop series. The relationships formed to collaboratively deliver this programming have helped University Libraries situate itself as a partner in research. Lessons learned include event timing, organizing and administering a growing, distributed program, creating effective channels for communicating across units and populations, and figuring out the types of events and rewards that matter to graduate students. In this short session, participants will learn about some of this program's successes, challenges, and future directions for growth and improvement so that they can come away with implementation ideas of their own.<br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li>Participants will gain insight into graduate students' data training needs<li>Participants will learn how a similar workshop series can be created at their institutions</li><li>Participants will learn about the certificate of completion and digital badge awarded to program completers.</li></ul></div></td></tr>

The presenter will share how a research data librarian is co-instructing on reproducibility with their school of medicine faculty. Although this class example is at a medical school, the presenter will also discuss the broader context of how the NIH emphasizes "rigor and reproducibility" in training programs. They will present how they frame reproducibility and data sharing in the wider context of health sciences and behavioral sciences trends, so that students understand the changing face of data practices in research. Finally, the presenter will share examples of resources that can be leveraged by data librarians or subject librarians for teaching about reproducibility and transparency.<br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li>(1) What the NIH means when talking about rigor, reproducibility, and transparency for graduate students; <li>(2) How the presenter collaborated to design course objectives; <li>(3) An example of how to use specific existing resources to create student activities about reproducibility</ul></div>

Data management is an essential skill for researchers in all disciplines, yet it can be tricky to teach it in a manner that sticks. This presentation (relevant to data librarians at any level with instruction responsibilities) will offer a lesson plan for teaching data management in reverse by first familiarizing students with the relevant data repositories in their discipline and then examining individual datasets they might reuse. It will also include insights from applying the lesson for a graduate-level entomology course. By having students focus on a personally relevant dataset, they not only learn about general data management best practices but also have an example of how those practices translate to their discipline.<br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li>1) develop class instruction that presents data management best practices as a set of solutions to data curation issues, and <li>2) leverage students' own identification of barriers to reusing data from repositories to connect good data management practices to the long-term value of their data</ul></div>
