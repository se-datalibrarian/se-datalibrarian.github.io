While it remains possible and vital to promote open science principles, librarians must be frank about the challenges facing researchers and communicate in a manner that takes their concerns seriously. Analyzing past studies on why researchers do not share data alongside current challenges, this presentation will discuss three distinct reasons researchers may be hesitant to share data—insufficient time or funds, fear of misrepresentation, and concern for misuse—and provide suggestions on how librarians of all levels can effectively engage with these concerns in outreach to researchers.</div>

<br /><br /><strong>Building a Data Services Plan from the Ground Up: A Practical Approach </strong><ul class="vertical-list"><li>Paul De Barros (Santa Clara University)</ul><button type="button" class="collapsible">Show/Hide Abstract</button><div class="content">With the need for data literacy and access to data resources growing among students and faculty, the Library at Santa Clara University recognized the need for a Data Services Plan. A primarily undergraduate teaching institution, SCU is pursuing a new strategic direction to support more faculty research, amplifying the need for the library to respond with intentionality and agility. However, data plan models for R01 institutions needed to be scaled appropriately to meet both current and projected needs. This poster outlines the process of developing a data services strategy from the ground up without prior experience or institutional precedent. It involved considering user needs, library capabilities, future planning, and building new partnerships.<br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li>What questions to ask when developing a data services plan</li><li>how to develop initiatives goals and specific activities to support them</li><li>creation of the plan as a professional development experience</ul></div>

Since many RDM publications/workshops focus on more advanced practices, I identified ‘good enough' data practices to meet researchers where they are in terms of RDM skills and time/effort they can dedicate. ‘Good enough' practices need to be low effort, have a shallow learning curve, have immediate and future benefits, and increase data reusability. I have delivered ‘good enough' practices to researchers at various stages from graduate students through mid-career faculty as part of stand-alone workshops, bootcamps, and choose-your-own-adventure style of training driven by audience interest. Feedback indicates attendees are motivated to implement these practices and often request additional, in-depth workshops on various RDM components. This presentation will appeal to attendees interested in providing RDM workshops in preparation for emerging open data policies.<br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li>Researchers may have advanced statistical or other data skills and still have gaps in research data management skills that limit the reusability of their data</li><li>Starting with ‘good enough' practices increases the likelihood that researchers will adopt changes and provides a foundation for more advanced open data practices</li><li>Framing research data management as a way to boost researcher productivity and lab efficiency can increase engagement and buy-in</li></ul></div>

Co-sponsored by University Libraries, Research Computing, and the Graduate School, SHARPGrads exposes graduate students in all disciplines to data skills and concepts that are required for graduate work but are often not included in the curriculum. Since its first iteration in 2019 as a two-day, in-person event, SHARPGrads has evolved into a year-long virtual workshop series. The relationships formed to collaboratively deliver this programming have helped University Libraries situate itself as a partner in research. Lessons learned include event timing, organizing and administering a growing, distributed program, creating effective channels for communicating across units and populations, and figuring out the types of events and rewards that matter to graduate students. In this short session, participants will learn about some of this program's successes, challenges, and future directions for growth and improvement so that they can come away with implementation ideas of their own.<br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li>Participants will gain insight into graduate students' data training needs<li>Participants will learn how a similar workshop series can be created at their institutions</li><li>Participants will learn about the certificate of completion and digital badge awarded to program completers.</li></ul></div></td></tr>

However, these assets often remain underutilized because of discovery and access barriers, particularly for researchers who lack programming expertise. Our proof-of-concept model addresses this challenge by reimagining how libraries can manage their licensed digital holdings. We propose a curation model that transforms licensed datasets into research-ready data products using Databricks, making these valuable assets more accessible to the wider research community. This system uses AI to enhance metadata, improving discovery and helping researchers locate the right assets quickly. It also allows for direct, in-browser interaction with the data, removing the need for large downloads or specialized software. By providing on-demand compute resources, the model allows researchers to provision the exact power they need for specific workloads in a fraction of the time, eliminating the traditional bottleneck of waiting for access to a supercomputer. This approach aligns with a library's core mission to democratize knowledge. By providing universal, scalable access to valuable data assets, we are helping libraries evolve their services to support computational scholarship and fulfill their role as stewards of information in the AI era.<br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li>Discover how a library's mission can be extended to provide access to data assets, serving a wider range of researchers using data intelligence platforms like Databricks</li><li>understand how leveraging AI for metadata management can improve the discoverability and usability of licensed datasets, saving researchers valuable time.</li></ul></div>

Given the current state of affairs, the tenuous availability of federal government data is proving to be a challenge for researchers who rely on this data, or who would like to, as well as librarians who support students and faculty of all levels working with government data. To understand how librarians are rethinking education around data literacy and the availability of government and other social science data in the context of this ever-changing landscape, I distributed a survey in spring 2025 to collect information on how librarians were making early adjustments to reference and instruction with social science data writ large. Early findings from the study will be discussed, as well as ways in which librarians can consider adapting their own research and instruction work.<br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li>Understand the challenges faced by librarians working with government or other social science data<li>Outline ways in which they can consider adapting their own instruction and reference work in light of changes to the availability of government data</ul></div>
<br /><br /><strong>Understanding Your Doctor's Data: A Health & Data Literacy Partnership Between Librarians</strong><ul class="vertical-list"><li>Chelsea Jacobs (University of Tennessee Knoxville)</ul><button type="button" class="collapsible">Show/Hide Abstract</button><div class="content">As the public navigates increasingly complex health data, libraries are uniquely positioned to bridge the gap between access and understanding. This poster presents Understanding Your Doctor's Data, a collaborative model led by medical and data librarians. Informed by the presenter's national survey on public perceptions of medical librarians, the poster explores how these professionals can work together to address confusion around clinical terms, lab results, and health statistics. Medical librarians offer subject expertise and patient-centered communication, while data librarians contribute data literacy frameworks and visualization skills. Together, they help participants critically assess health information and reduce reliance on unverified sources like "Dr. Google." This poster underscores the role of cross-disciplinary librarian partnerships in promoting health equity and advancing public-facing data education.<br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li>Learn how medical and data librarians can collaboratively design and deliver public programs that improve understanding of clinical data, such as lab results and risk statistics<li>Discover practical approaches to integrating health and data literacy efforts to combat misinformation and support health equity in library settings.</ul></div>

M3gan. WALL-E. Popular culture has explored humanity's hopes and fears regarding AI for decades. And yet, our development and use of AI has been much less critical and more reckless. From environmental impacts to "hallucinations" to therapy bots, this poster will cover the costs of GenAI on our planet, our culture, and ourselves; examples of the intersection of GenAI and data librarianship; as well as "GenAI refusal", the AI Disclosure Framework, and tools for assessing AI, including Tribelhorn's Ethical AI Assessment Tool. Whether you're a skeptic or enthusiast, this poster will provide a counterpoint to the rapid adoption of AI tools<br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li>The costs of AI<li>The impact of AI on research and learning<li>Our professional, ethical responsibility when encountering AI in our work.</ul></div>
<br /><br /><strong>A Literature Review of Hosting Multilingual Content in Institutional Repositories </strong><ul class="vertical-list"><li>Amina Malik (University of Illinois Chicago)</ul><button type="button" class="collapsible">Show/Hide Abstract</button><div class="content">This presentation covers a literature review on multilingual research ephemera in western institutional repositories (IRs). While speculation of anglophone research publication is rampant in the field of scholarly communications as it pertains to academic publishing in peer-reviewed journals, literature covering the theoretics, policies, and case studies exploring non-English, non-Romanized research ephemera in IRs is sparse. As more western universities work towards strong IR infrastructures at their institutions, they must also keep in mind the scholars they support from non-native-English backgrounds when writing policy, conducting outreach, shaping metadata standards and investing in translation resources. Highlighted in this presentation are examples of institutions who have successfully created diverse IRs able to disseminate research ephemera that goes beyond the lingua franca. This presentation will be most beneficial to practitioners in the scholarly communications and data librarianship field, both who interact with their IRs and support non-native-English speakers in disseminating their research ephemera.<br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li>Attendees will be able to identify sociopolitical histories that have contributed to English as the lingua franca of academic publishing<li>Attendees will be able to shape outreach of repositories at their institutions that welcome international and non-native-English speakers to share their research<li>Attendees will be able to apply takeaways from case studies to provide support to international and non-native-English scholars towards disseminating their research.</ul></div>
<br /><br /><strong>Data Reflections: How a data services internship prepares librarians for a modern workforce</strong><ul class="vertical-list"><li>Fadhia Mohamud (University of Kentucky)<li>Jake Gibson (University of Michigan)<li>Nadia Merritt</ul><button type="button" class="collapsible">Show/Hide Abstract</button><div class="content">As participants of a ten-week summer internship teaching practical skills related to data librarianship, we dove into projects reviewing the metadata fields of an institutional data repository at an R1 university. Through three projects—revising the repository's depositor guide, conducting an environmental scan of metadata fields offered by peer institutions, and reassessing the licenses offered by the repository—we developed recommendations to make the repository more accessible, reusable, and open. This poster will include self-reflection from the participants on how these projects have better prepared them to be data librarians, support open scholarship, ponder strategies of best practices for data preservation, and analyze data structures. This poster will provide valuable insight into the impact of training on the growth of current and recent graduate students so they can become competitive for data librarian positions and grow in this complex and dynamic field.</div>
<br /><br /><strong>First Free-Text Field Audit: Three Interns' Investigations of ICPSR's Metadata Schema</strong><ul class="vertical-list"><li>Anna Hill <li>Noah J Hernandez (UCLA)<li>Viviana Martinez (UW)</ul><button type="button" class="collapsible">Show/Hide Abstract</button><div class="content">As a part of an online internship with a national data education center, we worked with a major social science data archive to examine a free text field in their local metadata schema: "Summary," "Collection Note," and "Data Source." Through our explorations and analysis, we developed recommendations for improving the metadata quality and depositor interface. Additionally, we developed recommendations for the implementation of the CARE principles for Indigenous data governance, investigating how a repository could implement the values and recommendations into their local metadata schema and data practices. In this poster, we will present our learnings and display our growth from our program, explain the skills we developed for the field of data librarianship skills, and demonstrate how the internship program supplemented our MLIS coursework by providing hands-on data experience and access to working professionals in a large data archive.</div>
<br /><br /><strong>Learning by Teaching: Developing Resources as a Model for Advancing Mixed Methods Research Proficiency through Experiential Learning</strong><ul class="vertical-list"><li>Tobi Adepoju<li>Alexandra Cross (Rutgers)<li>Kathleen Konno (UNT)</ul><button type="button" class="collapsible">Show/Hide Abstract</button><div class="content">As graduate students participating in a ten-week internship experience, we analyzed a multiple-institution survey facilitated by Weill Cornell Medicine in 2023-24. Because the survey responses included qualitative data, we were given access to MAXQDA, a mixed-methods data analysis software none of us had ever used before. To support our own learning and to create a resource for other new users, we created a LibGuide that documented our process and offered practical guidance. This poster will cover how creating a resource guide for a tool we were unfamiliar with reinforced our own understanding of the software, gave us experience with developing instructional materials, and helped us gain confidence in doing qualitative research. This poster presentation would be of interest to those seeking out internship opportunities, early career professionals, or instructors looking for experiential approaches to student learning.</div></td></tr>

The annual displays sustain high participation with 400-600 interactions per event. This low-stakes programming offers visitors a fun and accessible way to get involved at the library. It also serves as an informal means to learn about patron interests and preferences. As an added benefit, the data collected can be repurposed for data literacy instruction. This type of event can promote cross-departmental collaboration by customizing the theme of the displays to spotlight new or relevant library resources. Over the years we have developed a protocol that requires minimal time, effort, and resources to prepare the displays. This presentation will review the steps involved in implementing a collaborate data visual display to equip attendees with the necessary information to replicate this experience at their organization.<br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li>Attendees will be able to organize and execute an interactive data visualization display that is scaled appropriately for their institution<li>Attendees will learn how to customize aspects of the display to boost engagement and cross-promote library resources and services and leverage data collected to promote data literacy.</ul></div></td></tr>
