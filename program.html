Altamirano (Auburn University)<li>Ali Krzton (Auburn University)     </ul><button type="button" class="collapsible">Show/Hide Abstract</button><div class="content">Citation analysis can be used to track journal usage in dissertations, aiding in collection development. Existing studies usually involve creating tabular data to analyze in Excel, and sometimes incorporate light scripting with R. In this talk, we share a new methodology in which PDF chemistry doctoral dissertations were converted to HTML to employ text-scraping techniques. Using Python, we extracted the journal and book titles from each citation and then arranged them into Pandas Dataframes for further analysis. This format provides numerous possibilities for fine-grained analysis of large datasets.<br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li>Learning a new way to conduct citation analysis <li>Using Python and Pandas Dataframes to analyze a large dataset</ul></div>
<br /><br /><strong>Teaching Data Literacy to Future Legal Professionals</strong><ul class="vertical-list"><li>Courtney Dalton (Cornell University)      </ul><button type="button" class="collapsible">Show/Hide Abstract</button><div class="content">Lawyers regularly engage with commercial legal research and intelligence platforms that boast of features based on data visualization, natural language processing, and machine learning; additionally, lawyers who operate within the criminal legal system must contend with the instrumentalization of algorithmic technologies in the public sphere. Given this situation, lawyers must possess data literacy in order to meet not only their obligations to their clients, but also what the American Bar Association characterizes as the profession's "special responsibility for the quality of justice." In spite of this, law school curricula are still inconsistent in equipping students with data literacy skills. This poster will describe my approach to incorporating data literacy into various instructional contexts as a data librarian, as well as challenges that I have encountered. While the topic will be suitable for all data librarians, it will be especially useful for librarians who work with students pursuing professional degrees.<br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li>Identify the opportunities and challenges associated with incorporating data literacy into a law school curriculum. <li>Relate law library experiences to other curricular contexts for data literacy instruction especially other forms of professional education.</ul></div>

However, many librarians working in these data-centric roles often discover that their MLIS coursework has left them ill-prepared for the practical data science skills they need in their jobs. While researchers have investigated the role of academic librarians in the data science landscape and the development of data curation curriculum, less attention has been paid to data education across the entire data lifecycle. Based on research conducted between summer 2022 and summer 2023, this poster maps the data lifecycle to current MLIS courses offered during this period in data science from ALA-accredited programs. Visualizing these trends can help attendees identify and advocate for future areas of curriculum growth to support future data librarians.<br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li>Understanding of current data science/literacy related coursework offered through MLIS programs <li>Understanding of potential knowledge gaps for incoming and current data librarians</ul></div>

Academic librarians have a distinct role in teaching data literacy to prepare students for the workforce. While student self-perception of their data literacy has been studied, limited research has investigated professionals with regards to using data literacy skills in practice.  This poster shares initial findings from a research survey examining how business data literacy competencies align with professional workplace practices. The presenters surveyed professionals within the supply chain and logistics industries, seeking information on their levels of data literacy, in what ways data literacy competencies are reflected in their work, and how they developed the data literacy skills required for their job. The findings help demonstrate how business data literacy competencies resonate from classroom to workplace and provide further context for teaching data literacy along with information literacy.<br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li>Attendees will be able to recognize the business data literacy competencies. <li>Attendees will be able to describe how surveyed workers rate their data literacy skills. <li>Attendees will be able to explain the value of librarians' role in teaching data literacy for workforce preparation. </ul></div></td></tr>

How data are used can also become its own social problem (e.g. misinformation or privacy issues). In 2022, I taught a one-credit-hour course for first-year students that introduced a variety of data literacy concepts and skills including basic data analysis, ethics, collection, and storytelling &mdash; with the goal of empowering students to use their data literacy skills for social change. Class activities, discussions, assignments, and projects focused on social issues &mdash; giving students the opportunity to practice their data literacy skills using meaningful and real-world issues. During this presentation I will highlight: (1) ways the course connected students to library resources, (2) assignments and activities from the course that can be used during library instruction, (3) and student feedback on the course. For all data librarians. <br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li>(1) examples of data literacy related assignments and discussions that can be completed during a 50-minute class period. <li>(2) a reading/media list used in the course with materials that are both relatively short and engaging. <li>(3) a strategy to appeal to students' interests in social issues as a way to foster data skills. </ul></div>

This presentation will provide an overview of the process Florida International University librarians went through to turn the papers of Dana A. Dorsey, Miami's first Black Millionaire, into data. Their work is guided by the concept of "collections as data" as a form of reparative archival practice, enabling the elevation of marginalized individuals' histories. The goal of reparative archival practice is to create a reflective practice that informs and challenges librarians and archivists to engage with different types of historical data to provide a more inclusive and comprehensive understanding of the past. The presentation will cover the ways in which ethical practices were implemented in each step of the initiative, including project planning, stakeholder involvement, data selection, and access.<br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li>Deriving Data from Historical Resources: Participants will gain technical insights into how data can be derived from text-rich historical resources. <li>Engaging in Reparative Archival Practice through "Collections as Data": The presentation will highlight the concept of "collections as data" as a form of reparative archival practice<li>where the histories of marginalized individuals can be elevated. <li>Striving for Ethical Practices in Data Collection: Participants will gain insights into the significance of integrating ethical practices across the entire data collection process encompassing project planning, stakeholder involvement, data selection, and access considerations.</ul></div>

The contributions of librarians to research data have been recognized beyond the library for our impact on topics like open science, reproducibility, bias and source critique, and data literacies. <br><br>The end-user-driven AI era is pulling all manner of data and texts into their models, including existing description and preservation practices. As a result, the skills to use and critique datasets will also help critique and use AI. <br><br>Dr. Exner will share examples of how data description and data instruction feed into a cycle that affects design and use of AI-driven systems. Building on those insights, attendees will envision how data-adjacent description and instruction and all of library data services are already tomorrow's AI services. <br><br>About the Speaker: <br>Dr. Nina Exner is the research data librarian at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, VA. They (or she) serves both the medical and nonmedical campuses of VCU. In that capacity, Nina advocates for data "as closed as it needs to be, and as open as it can be." Nina works closely with the national Research Development community, helping grant writers and faculty development professionals to incorporate library services into the research enterprise. In addition, Nina has occupied national service roles in the NIH DMS Plan implementation period. These roles have included being the inaugural NNLM National Center for Data Services Ambassador and co-chairing the DMPTool working group on the NIH DMS Plan.

Data librarians possess much of the knowledge and skills necessary to assist researchers throughout the lifecycle of their projects, providing assistance on everything from data management and sharing plans to the eventual archival of various research products. However, librarians and researchers do not always speak the same language or prioritize the same outcomes for research products. As someone nearing the completion of a Ph.D. in biology and serving as a Research Data Specialist in an academic library, I can contribute perspectives as both a researcher and research support staff. Using my own personal experience as well as evidence from empirical research, I will discuss problematic divides and promising overlaps between researchers and data librarians and recommend strategies for more effective cooperation between these two groups. <br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li>Attendees will be able to assess the relationship between librarians and researchers at their institution and implement manageable changes to improve that relationship. <li>Attendees will be able to evaluate how their current research support services and priorities might align or conflict with the needs and wants of researchers.</ul></div>

In this talk, I will delve into the successes and challenges encountered in this BIPOC-centered data services training. By thoroughly examining the experiences of this internship and the program's impact, I will explore its contributions to fostering diversity within the data services profession. I will discuss interns' experiences, including their acquisition of valuable skills and introduction into the data librarian community. Nevertheless, I will also candidly acknowledge that no program is without its challenges. Therefore, I will address the obstacles faced within the program, such as building a sense of community in remote work settings, managing limited time, and addressing site onboarding complexities.<br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li>By sharing insights, experiences, and lessons learned the talk aims to inspire continued efforts in creating inclusive and equitable opportunities for aspiring data professionals from underrepresented backgrounds<li>particularly in the context of recent scrutiny of diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives nationally. <li>This talk also aims to be informative for those interested in participating in such a program or creating similar programs. </ul></div>
<br /><br />11:55 AM<br /><strong>Researcher Attitudes to Data Curation at the Qualitative Data Repository (QDR) after a Data Publication</strong><ul class="vertical-list"><li>Dessi Kirilova (Qualitative Data Repository, Syracuse University)<li>Sebastian Karcher (Qualitative Data Repository, Syracuse University)    </ul><button type="button" class="collapsible">Show/Hide Abstract</button><div class="content">We report results from a study that explores how researchers whose data projects were published by the Qualitative Data Repository perceive the curation services provided by QDR. As part of a broader project, we query two user groups: researchers who have completed a data publication via QDR and researchers who have initiated deposits but whose project has not yet been published. With the help of both groups' answers, we aim to address two questions: 1) how do researchers judge the value of services provided by QDR and 2) what are major obstacles and pain points experienced by researchers attempting to share qualitative data. We base our questionnaire in large part on a protocol developed by the Data Curation Network, and so add to scholarship on the value of curation more generally, with a comparative lens specifically trained on qualitative social scientists. In this short presentation, we focus on the responses by those researchers whose data have been published, as we hope their successful experiences provide insights which data librarians &mdash; a key liaison between researchers and repositories &mdash;  can apply to assist future candidates for qualitative data publication.<br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li>Data librarians will learn what factors have assisted qualitative social scientists with completing a data publication. <li>Data librarians repository personnel and curation experts will gain a comparative perspective on researcher attitudes toward human data curation. <li>Attendees will receive general good-practice recommendations based on researchers' experience with QDR that should assist data publication.</ul></div></td></tr>
